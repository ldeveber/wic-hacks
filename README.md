===========

This is a quick talk on getting a page styled and functional with Twitter Bootstrap. Slides are in `slides`, and the examples are in `example`. The slides have notes, so make sure to hit `s` on the slides page to see them!

The example page is served with grunt, and assumes you have <a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">nodejs</a> installed already. To build the examples:

```bash
cd example
npm install
grunt serve
```

Also see supplemental talk on starting a nitrous.io instance for rails <a href="https://github.com/tiffanypeon/RIT_Hack" target="_blank">here</a>. Nitrous.io also supports node, and this project *should* run there but I have not tried it yet.

The examples will be available at: http://localhost:8001/
